**Finding Lane Lines on the Road**

The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Make a pipeline that finds lane lines on the road
* Reflect on your work in a written report

### Reflection

### 1. Describe your pipeline. As part of the description, explain how you modified the draw_lines() function.

My pipeline consisted of 5 steps. First, I converted the images to grayscale, then I processed the image with gaussian_blur function. The output of the gaussian function was served as input to canny function with some tuning of parameters. The canned image was passed to hough transformation, then I used predefined weighted image function and marked the regions of interest. It was a straight away process taught in the previous videos and quizzes. I couldn't really get what I need to do for extrapolation and averaging of lines in draw_lines function.


### 2. Identify potential shortcomings with your current pipeline
