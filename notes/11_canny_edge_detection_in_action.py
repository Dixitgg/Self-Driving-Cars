# Canny Edge Detection in Action
#
# Now that you have a conceptual grasp on how the Canny algorithm works, it's time to use it to find the edges of the
# lane lines in an image of the road. So let's give that a try.
#
# First, we need to read in an image:

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib.image as mpimg

image = mpimg.imread('exit-ramp.png')
plt.imshow(image)

# show it before
plt.show()

# Let's go ahead and convert to grayscale
import cv2  # bringing in OpenCV libraries

gray = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)  # grayscale conversion
plt.imshow(gray, cmap='gray')

# show image as grayscale
plt.show()

# Letâ€™s try our Canny edge detector on this image. This is where OpenCV gets useful. First, we'll have a look at the
# parameters for the OpenCV Canny function. You will call it like this:

edges = cv2.Canny(gray, low_threshold, high_threshold)

# In this case, you are applying Canny to the image gray and your output will be another image called edges. low_
# threshold and high_threshold are your thresholds for edge detection.

# The algorithm will first detect strong edge (strong gradient) pixels above the high_threshold, and reject pixels below
# the low_threshold. Next, pixels with values between the low_threshold and high_threshold will be included as long as
# they are connected to strong edges. The output edges is a binary image with white pixels tracing out the detected
# edges and black everywhere else. See the OpenCV Canny Docs for more details.
#
#  OpenCV Canny Docs: http://docs.opencv.org/2.4/doc/tutorials/imgproc/imgtrans/canny_detector/canny_detector.html


# What would make sense as a reasonable range for these parameters? In our case, converting to grayscale has left us
# with an 8-bit image, so each pixel can take 2^8 = 256 possible values. Hence, the pixel values range from 0 to 255.
#
# 8-bit: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8-bit

# This range implies that derivatives (essentially, the value differences from pixel to pixel) will be on the scale of
# tens or hundreds. So, a reasonable range for your threshold parameters would also be in the tens to hundreds.


# As far as a ratio of low_threshold to high_threshold, John Canny himself recommended a low to high ratio
# of 1:2 or 1:3.

# We'll also include Gaussian smoothing, before running Canny, which is essentially a way of suppressing noise and
# spurious gradients by averaging (check out the OpenCV docs for GaussianBlur). You can choose the kernel_size for
# Gaussian smoothing to be any odd number. A larger kernel_size implies averaging, or smoothing, over a larger area.
# The example in the previous lesson was kernel_size = 3.

# OpenCV docs for GaussianBlur:
#
# http://docs.opencv.org/2.4/modules/imgproc/doc/filtering.html?highlight=gaussianblur#gaussianblur


# Note: If this is all sounding complicated and new to you, don't worry! We're moving pretty fast through the material
# here, because for now we just want you to be able to use these tools. If you would like to dive into the math
# underpinning these functions, please check out the free Udacity course, Intro to Computer Vision, where the third
# lesson covers Gaussian filters and the sixth and seventh lessons cover edge detection.

# Read in the image and convert to grayscale
